<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Below-Grade Waterproofing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bitumen</li><li>Bentonite</li><li>Rubberized Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Below-grade waterproofing encompasses various materials that prevent water intrusion in subterranean structures. Bitumen, a petroleum-based product, forms a durable, flexible barrier suitable for cryogenic temperatures, often used in membranes. Bentonite, a natural clay, swells when wet, creating a self-sealing layer ideal for earth-contact applications. Rubberized asphalt combines asphalt with rubber polymers, enhancing elasticity and waterproofing properties, effectively resisting cracking and aging. Each type serves specific needs in construction and protection against groundwater and moisture damage.</p></p>
