<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro Absorption Modulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorptive Modulators</li><li>Refractive Modulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electro Absorption Modulators (EAMs) can be classified into two main types: absorptive modulators and refractive modulators. Absorptive modulators operate by changing the absorption characteristics of the material when an electric field is applied, allowing for efficient signal modulation. In contrast, refractive modulators alter the index of refraction, affecting how light propagates through the medium. Both types are essential for high-speed data transmission in optical communication, with applications in telecommunications, data centers, and advanced networking technologies.</p></p>
