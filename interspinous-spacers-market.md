<p><strong>The Interspinous Spacers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Compressible Spacers</li><li>Compressible Spacers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The interspinous spacers market is divided into two main types: non-compressible spacers and compressible spacers. Non-compressible spacers are rigid devices designed to maintain a fixed distance between adjacent spinous processes, providing stability and support while limiting movement. In contrast, compressible spacers are flexible and designed to adapt under pressure, offering the ability to absorb loads and reduce stress on spinal structures. Both types aim to alleviate spinal conditions and improve patient outcomes through enhanced spinal alignment and stability.</p></p>
